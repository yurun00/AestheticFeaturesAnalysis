At first, there were folder 'oil_used', 'wikipaintings.xlsx', 'wikipaintings_genre.xlsx', 'wikipaintings_style.xlsx' which contain information about dataset, paintings' names, paintings' genres and paintings'styles. But the paintings' dataset in 'oil_used' does not match that in 'wikipaintings.xlsx'. So I extracted the directory of 'oil_used' and exported it to 'oil_used.xlsx'. 

Then I chose those paintings which exist in 'oil_used.xlsx' and 'wikipaintings.xlsx' simultaneously and exported their information to 'paintings.xlsx', 'paintings_genre.xlsx', 'paintings_style.xlsx'. 

However, when I extratcted the RGB image data with matlab command 'imread', some images caused error. The line numbers of those images' names in 'paintings.xlsx' are 1230, 1361, 1716, 8860, 10216. So I download these paintings from other website and save all the image data as '.mat' files.

The numbers of samples for each genre or style are too large to perform well on the machine. So I selected 120 samples for each genre and style randomly and save them in the folder global_var.
